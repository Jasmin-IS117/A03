# WHAT IS GITHUB
GitHub is a free GIT repository tool that provides web-based platform for people to work together on projects around the world. Here, you can create a Hello World repository and use the Pull Requesst workflow option.

# GIT
Git, as mentioned previously, stores files as information into what is called a repository. A git repository is a location of a file that stores information related to your project. Think of it similarly to a folder. When you revise a file, it is called a commit. The commit allows you to keep track of the changes made and usually includes a small description of the change. To push is the same as sending your committed changes into a remote repository. A clone is a copy of the repository which is saved as file in your computer rather than on a web-based interface. With a clone, you can edit on your preferred platform. When you make changes, it is connected to the remote version that helps to sync the two when changes are made. To pull refers to take changes made into your file and adding them to an updated version. A branch is a different version of the repository. You can edit this repository without actually changing the primary version of the repository. If you would like, you can choose to update the original version with changes on the branch. To add changes into the original version means to merge. Fetching means to get the last changes you made on your repository without having to merge the information. Sometimes, merge conflicts may occur, which is when people make changes on the same line of the same file or if someone edits a file and may choose to delete it.

# Getting Started
To get started, first make a GitHub account. You will first come across a screen with the repository labelled helloworld. Click on the settings icon to change the name of your repository. Once you have changed the name, click on the pencil icon on the top right corner. This icon is used to edit your information. Once you're finished, write a description of the commit changes and then click on commit changes. You edited your first repository file!
